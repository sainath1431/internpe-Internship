// Coding Challenge #4

/*
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜… (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/

//By using Conditional Operator (ternary  operator)

// const bill = 430;
// const tip = (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) ? 0.15 * bill : 0.2 * bill;
// console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);

// The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25
// The bill was 40, the tip was 8, and the total value 48
//The bill was 430, the tip was 86, and the total value 516

// By using if esle statement.

// let bill = 275;
// let tip;

// if (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) {
//     tip = bill * 0.15;
// } else {
//     tip = bill * 0.2;
// }

// console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);
